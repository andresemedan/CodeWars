// Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

// Examples:
// 1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
// 2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
// 3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
// 4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5


function isDivisible(n, x, y) {
    if( n / x || n / y){
        return true
    }else{
        return false

// Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

// Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

// Example:
// h = 0
// m = 1
// s = 1

// result = 61000
// Input constraints:

// 0 <= h <= 23
// 0 <= m <= 59
// 0 <= s <= 59

function past(h, m, s){
    //#Happy Coding! ^_^
    return (h * 3600000) + (m * 60000) + (s * 1000)
  }


//   It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script.

// Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

// The array will never be empty.

function getAverage(marks){
    //TODO : calculate the downward rounded average of the marks array
    return Math.floor( marks.reduce((acc,curr)=> acc + curr, 0  ) / marks.length)
  }
